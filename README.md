# LangChain-AI-Powered-Information-Retrieval-Advance_RAG-

## 🚀 Overview

This LangChain-based Jupyter Notebook integrates multiple retrieval tools, including Wikipedia, Arxiv, and FAISS-powered vector search, to create an AI-driven information retrieval agent. The system leverages Google Gemini AI (via LangChain) to enhance search capabilities and generate intelligent responses based on retrieved content.

## 🛠 Features

✅ Wikipedia Search: Retrieves concise Wikipedia summaries.

✅ Web Scraping & Text Processing: Extracts data from websites and splits text efficiently.

✅ FAISS Vector Search: Enables similarity-based document retrieval using HuggingFace embeddings.

✅ Arxiv Paper Retrieval: Fetches academic papers from Arxiv for research purposes.

✅ LangSmith Search Agent: Uses an AI-powered retriever to answer LangSmith-related queries.

✅ Google Gemini Integration: Utilizes Gemini 1.5 Flash as the core LLM for answering user queries.

## 🔧 How It Works

Wikipedia & Arxiv Wrappers: Fetches relevant articles and research papers.

Web Data Loader: Loads and processes data from LangSmith documentation.

FAISS Vector Store: Converts documents into vector embeddings for similarity search.

AI-Powered Retriever Agent:

Uses FAISS-based semantic search.

Enhances accuracy by fetching top-matching documents.

Gemini AI LLM Integration:

Accepts user queries and generates intelligent responses.

Uses Google's Gemini AI to process and synthesize retrieved content.

LangChain Agents: Enables an AI-driven agent executor for information retrieval.
